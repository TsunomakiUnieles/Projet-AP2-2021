# L1-S2_ProjetSlitherlink_AP2

This is a project for the class "ALGORITHMIQUE ET PROGRAMMATION 2" in 1st year of Computer Science at Universit√© Gustave Eiffel.

It is a Slitherlink inspired game coded with Python using fltk.py, a graphical library based on tkinter made by the educational team of the University.

## Usage

Execute Slitherlink.py in it's directory
```bash
python Slitherlink.py
```

For more details, please read the project report written in French

## State of the project

The basic functionalities of the game are completed but advanced functionalities such as the auto-solver are not.

This repository is unlikely to be updated.

## Note for my juniors

I highly discourage you from plagiarizing this project as it is intellectual dishonesty to turn in work that is not yours.
The source is public and if they find you, you will FAIL the class.
